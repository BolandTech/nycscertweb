1. Understand the basics of object oriented computer programming
   including classes, methods, variables, data flow, data types and
   data structures.
2. Write programs of moderate complexity
3. Acquire data from outside sources and use programming techniques to
   analyze data and visualize results.
5. Use techniques from the field of computer science and apply them to
   problems in other fields.
